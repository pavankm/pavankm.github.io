      <description>Post 1 in my series of reflections on Stoicism
 Today I had the opportunity to listen to Ryan Holiday, author of The Daily Stoic, Ego Is The Enemy and more, talk about stoicism and its applicability to leadership.
I have been fascinated with Stoicism since I read Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Julius Caesar back in 10th grade. The way it was explained to us - Stoics are people who refuse to feel emotion; whether it is bad news or good, they react to it the same way.</description>
