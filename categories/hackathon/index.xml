      <description>I was at UW-Madison&amp;rsquo;s Madhacks Mini today. This was a 12 hour, beginner-friendly mini-hackathon to give new hackers a glimpse into what hackathons are like.
So why hack? What are the chances that I will wake up at 8 AM on a Saturday, wolf down whatever breakfast I can get my hands on and get down to brainstorming, coding and trying out new things? Practically nothing.
Stashed across Keep and One Note and Wunderlist are ideas of things I wanted to build, ideas that seem really cool but are relegated to being looked at longingly every other week - &amp;ldquo;If only I had time&amp;rdquo;.</description>
