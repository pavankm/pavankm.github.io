      <description>I have avoided writing about this topic for really long primarily because I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I have the wisdom to form an opinion, the ability to elucidate my uncertainties, or the sensitivity to question without offence. But it is a gaping hole in my thoughts that weighs heavily upon me every time I pay it the slightest attention.
What follows is not going to lead to an answer. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there is an answer.</description>

      <title>Why Stoicism</title>

      <description>“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” ― Socrates.
 Why then must you not strengthen your mind the same way?
The bedrock of stoicism is this one thought: Control what you can and accept what you can&amp;rsquo;t. An offshoot of accepting that way of living is that you learn to turn obstacles to your advantage.</description>

      <description>Post 1 in my series of reflections on Stoicism
 Today I had the opportunity to listen to Ryan Holiday, author of The Daily Stoic, Ego Is The Enemy and more, talk about stoicism and its applicability to leadership.
I have been fascinated with Stoicism since I read Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Julius Caesar back in 10th grade. The way it was explained to us - Stoics are people who refuse to feel emotion; whether it is bad news or good, they react to it the same way.</description>

      <title>Why Write</title>

      <description>Why create a blog at all and why write about random things? Things people may not care about or find &amp;lsquo;useful&amp;rsquo;.
George Orwell said that there are 4 reasons to write:
 Sheer egoism- The desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc. Aesthetic enthusiasm- The desire to create something beautiful. Having &amp;ldquo;pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story.</description>
