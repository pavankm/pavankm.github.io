This site was built using the Hugo static site generator. [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Future Imperfect theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/future-imperfect/)

I found the Giraffe Academy Youtube tutorial about hugo very helpful in understanding how hugo works.
Link for the interested: [Giraffe Academy Hugo - Static Site Generator | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3)

The site is hosted on my github repo [pavankm/pavankm.github.io](https://github.com/pavankm/pavankm.github.io)

I purchased the domain name from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) using the github student pack.
