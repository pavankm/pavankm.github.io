Why create a blog at all and why write about random things? Things people may not care about or find 'useful'.

George Orwell said that there are 4 reasons to write:

1. Sheer egoism- The desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc.
2. Aesthetic enthusiasm- The desire to create something beautiful. Having "pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story."
3. Historical impulse- The desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.
4. Political purpose- The desire to push the world in a certain direction.

The first three hold true for me, I started my first blog @ [DDSOS](http://ddsos.wordpress.com) because I fancied myself a writer of stories and poems. It is very evident from reading some of my early stuff that I was, to quote Stephen Fry - whom I adore, it a dream to meet and have a conversation with him one day - "inebriated by the exuberance of my own verbosity".

I'd like to add two personal motives to Orwell's list:

_conscientiousness and depth_

I read a lot of random things throughout the day, everyday. But I seldom dwell on anything long enough to understand it in depth. I hope that in attempting to write a well structured post, I will also think about things deeply enough.

_overcome the fear of my thoughts being read_

The sheer egoism that made me write in the first place has been replaced by a deep seated insecurity and hesitation to voice my thoughts and opinions for the fear of being wrong and so judged. I want to be okay with being wrong, with people not agreeing and accepting my opinions, I want to be okay being seen as stupid by people, I want to not feel less when people laugh or are sarcastic about my efforts. All that matters is that I am getting better at the things I want to be good at. To hell with everything else.
