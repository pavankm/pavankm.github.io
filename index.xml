      <description>&lt;p&gt;“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” ― Socrates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bedrock of stoicism is this one thought: Control what you can and accept what you can&amp;rsquo;t. An offshoot of accepting that way of living is that you learn to turn obstacles to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Post 1 in my series of reflections on Stoicism&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I had the opportunity to listen to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Ryan Holiday&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, author of The Daily Stoic, Ego Is The Enemy and more, talk about stoicism and its applicability to leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been fascinated with Stoicism since I read Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;;s Julius Caesar back in 10th grade. The way it was explained to us - Stoics are people who refuse to feel emotion; whether it is bad news or good, they react to it the same way. It seemed like a nutty way to live. I understood and appreciated the part about taking bad news on an even keel, but refusing to react in joy? What was the point of living?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have avoided writing about this topic for really long primarily because I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I have the wisdom to form an opinion, the ability to elucidate my uncertainties, or the sensitivity to question without offence. But it is a gaping hole in my thoughts that weighs heavily upon me every time I pay it the slightest attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What follows is not going to lead to an answer. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there is an answer.&#xA;While waiting to switch flights in Chicago I saw a couple feed and converse as much as they could with their developmentally challenged daughter. They didn&amp;rsquo;t seem weary, they had a smile on their faces and the patience they showed, pardon my use of a meme, restored my faith in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a software engineer with a passion for building elegant solutions to complex problems. For the past eight years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at the intersection of technology and design, creating tools that people actually want to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My approach is simple: write clear code, ship quickly, and iterate based on feedback. I believe the best software is invisible—it just works, without demanding attention or requiring a manual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m not writing code, you&amp;rsquo;ll find me writing essays about technology, reading classic literature, or tinkering with vintage mechanical keyboards. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in how we can build software that lasts, systems that remain maintainable for decades rather than months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
