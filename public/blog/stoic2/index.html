            <blockquote>
<p>“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” ― Socrates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why then must you not strengthen your mind the same way?</p>
<hr>
<p>The bedrock of stoicism is this one thought: Control what you can and accept what you can&rsquo;t. An offshoot of accepting that way of living is that you learn to turn obstacles to your advantage.</p>
<p>Put in other words - chose what you want to give a F*$k about. You have a limited number of F&rsquo;s to give so why spend them on things you can not possibly control or change?</p>
<p>But why spend any time and mental energy rewiring your brain to think a different way at all?</p>
<p>I believe there is a strength in the stoic way of thinking and living. Even if you never come close to achieving the stoic ideal - there is a process that makes you more refined, puts you in the fire and on the anvil and you end up better for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school&hellip;it is to solve  some of the problems of life not only theoretically, but practically. - Thoreau</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is my problem?</p>
<p>I notice myself being sensitive to the attitudes and words of people around me. A bad tempered person sours me, a rude comment sets off a train of thought in my mind, and foul moods are infectious. All these vulnerabilities diminish me and my potential.
So often have I turned in a sub-par performance because someone was difficult. Too often have I not been conscientious because someone was nasty. When the choleric clouds disperse I find myself lacking faith in myself and feeling like a lesser person.</p>
<p>To many it seems elementary. Why give a fuck about people at all? It is so obvious. My point is, it is not obvious to me - so indulge me.</p>
<p>The stoic sage is an impossible ideal - to be sick and happy, disgraced and happy, in danger and perfectly calm. But it an ideal worth aspiring to because of the path it takes.</p>
<p>The first step is the Discipline of perception. How can it help my case?</p>
<p>When dealing with difficult people, I like to tell myself: People are not evil. They are stupid, incompetent, looking out for themselves or ignorant. But people are not evil. It has helped me separate the words from the voice.
I can not help that someone has a nasty disposition, that someone loses their lid when they can&rsquo;t help you, that people find it offensive to their person if you do not immediately see their ability. All that stems from things I do not know - ego, self doubt, a difficult day or simply not being able to communicate - things I can not control and are not my fault.</p>
<p>I do not want to feel anger in the face of inability, frustration is the face of disappointment and hostility in the face of misbehavior. The first step is to internalize that I can not control the way people act, only the way I react.</p>
