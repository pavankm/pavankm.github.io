  <div class="post-content"><p>I have avoided writing about this topic for really long primarily because I don&rsquo;t believe I have the wisdom to form an opinion, the ability to elucidate my uncertainties, or the sensitivity to question without offence. But it is a gaping hole in my thoughts that weighs heavily upon me every time I pay it the slightest attention.</p>
<p>What follows is not going to lead to an answer. I don&rsquo;t know if there is an answer.
While waiting to switch flights in Chicago I saw a couple feed and converse as much as they could with their developmentally challenged daughter. They didn&rsquo;t seem weary, they had a smile on their faces and the patience they showed, pardon my use of a meme, restored my faith in humanity.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who is developmentally challenged badly enough that he will have to be cared for his whole life. I saw my family show such unconditional love and patience and hope, and I saw others show disregard, resignation, as they distanced themselves from this burden. This situation made me question myself, what would I do if I had to care for someone&rsquo;s every need, what would I do if I had to be cared for day and night?</p>
<p>Thinking about this makes me feel guilty. How can I go about my life indulging in whatever I want, trying to achieve something when I have not answered these questions? What will it even mean if I am unable to fill in the holes?</p>
<p>A lame deer, a less than intelligent tiger or a bird with a limp wing will not survive in the wild. To be less than capable of completely caring for yourself is a death sentence. Humanity transcends this. We care for our weak, our helpless, the ones who wouldn&rsquo;t survive in the wild. To see people who care without ask, help people who can give nothing back, spread love and smiles to those who can&rsquo;t help themselves, it makes me question every single one of my actions, fills me with hope and with despair.</p>
<p>Can I get angry with those who recuse themselves from the responsibility of caring for the helpless? They made a call that is right for them, to not take on something they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t handle. Does that make them bad people? If not does taking on the responsibility of caring for someone their whole lives make a person a good person? Does questioning it make me a bad person?</p>
<p>What complicates this question is that it can be extended to the old, the unfortunate who have bad turns of fate. I could not imagine attempting to lead my life if my parents needed my care. As for everyone else, I do not know. I do not think I will know until the situation is thrust upon me, even then I can only be certain that I will have moments of uncertainty.</p>
<p>I do know the answer to the question on the other side. If I am ever in a situation where I can&rsquo;t fend for myself, I want to go the way of the lame deer or the limp bird. This leads to some rather interesting fears - and hopefully interesting articles.</p>
